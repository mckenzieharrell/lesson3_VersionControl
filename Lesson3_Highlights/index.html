            <p class="lead"> Github is a website that we used in this lesson and it is a website where you can take advantage of version control. You can store and save versions of websites all on github and you can allow them to be shared with other people. By creating a github account, you can share and create multiple webpages and other people can access your material and they can use it also. Github is also a place where repositories can be freely created and used for other website development apps. Github has many benefits and I am excited to learn more about it in this class.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control is very important in understanding how to make and create websites. It allows changes to be made to a file or a group of files and then you can look back on these versions after time passes in order to reuse these files/versions. There are version control systems and they can collect and organize the files and website designs you want to save. Version control systems also make it easy to share designs and versions of images/files/websites with other website designers. Another benefit of using version control is that if you mess one file up or accidentally lose it, a version control system has the original file saved. </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Since I explained what a Version Control System was previously, I would like to also talk about how some of the benefits of a Version Control System.  One very important aspect of a VCS is that files cannot be overwritten. That is beneficial because files can be created and built on from their original form but that original saved file will never go away even though you can change it and add to it. Secondly, many people can be using the same file at once, without running into any issues. This is nice because there is no confusion or mixing up of files being created and no one ever really loses files or anything. These are only a couple of the many benefits of a VCS.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> On github, we learned about many of the github commands that are essential to understanding hoq to use github. Firstly, there is the git init command which is useful because it will create a completely new github repository. Another important git command to know about is git push. Git push is used when it is necessary to push of a file to only one brance like to the master branch of the website that is being created. A final command of git that I would like to explain is git log. Git log basically shows you what was done to a remote repository after you fetched it from another website. These are only a few of the very basic but vital git commands. </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> In the web development world, a remote repository is a file that is named something particular and can be shared and moved throughout web development apps like Github and Cloud9. Remotes also allow you to share a file that has been created to be easily moved around and inserted into multiple Cloud9 documents. It can get tricky when it comes to moving remotes around and managing the repositories throughout different webpages you are creating. Remote repositories are complicated but once you figure out how to move them around and change them as you please, they can be very beneficial to web app development. </p>
